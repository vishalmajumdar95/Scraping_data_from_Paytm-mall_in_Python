## Requirements

## BeautifulSoup

Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping. If you're using Linux based OS, you can install BeautifulSoup using following command in terminal.

Here, pip is a package-management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python.

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install beautifulsoup4

After finishing the installation process above, you can run the task, using `paytm_scrape.py`
